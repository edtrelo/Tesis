  abstract = {The sequential estimation of the states (filtering) and the corresponding simultaneous estimation of the states and fixed parameters of a dynamic state-space model, being linear or not, is an important probleminmany fields of research, such as in the area of finance.  The main objective of this research is to estimate sequ entially and efficiently –from a Bayesian perspective via the particle filtering methodology– the states and/or the fixed parameters of a nonstandard dynamic state-spacemodel: one that is possibly nonlinear, non-stationary or non-Gaussian.  The present thesis consists of seven chapters and is structured into two parts. Chapter 1 introduces basic concepts, themotivation, the purpose, and the outline of the thesis. Chapters 2-4, the first part of the thesis, focus on the estimation of the states. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive review of themost classic algorithms (non-simulation based: KF, EKF, and UKF; and simulation based: SIS, SIR, ASIR, EPF, and UPF1) used for filtering solely the states of a dynamic statespacemodel. All these filters scattered in the literature are not only described in detail, but also placed  in a unified notation for the sake of consistency, readability and comparability. Chapters 3 and 4 confirm the efficiency of the well-established particle filtering methodology, via extensive Monte Carlo (MC) studies, when estimating only the latent states for a dynamic state-space model, being linear or not. Also, complementary MC studies are conducted to analyze some relevant issues within the adopted approach, such as the degeneracy problem, the resampling strategy, or the possible impact on estimation of the number of particles used and the time series length.  Chapter 3 specifically illustrates the performance of the particle filtering methodology in a linear and Gaussian context, using the exact Kalman filter as a benchmark. The performance of the four studied particle filter variants (SIR, SIRopt, ASIR, KPF, the latter being a special case of the EPF algorithm) is assessed using two apparently simple, but important time series processes: the so-called Local Level Model (LLM) and the AR(1) plus noise model, which are non-stationary and stationary, respectively. An exhaustive study on the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over the quality of the estimation is additionally performed. ComplementaryMC studies are conducted to assess the degree of degeneracy and the possible effect of increasing the number of particles and the time series length. Chapter 4 assesses and illustrates the performance of the particle filtering methodology in a nonlinear context. Specifically, a synthetic nonlinear, non Gaussian and non-stationary state space model taken from literature is used to illustrate the performance of the four competing particle filters under study (SIR, ASIR, EPF, UPF) in contraposition to two well-known non-simulation based filters (EKF, UKF). In this chapter, the residual and stratified resampling schemes are compared and the effect of increasing the number of particles is addressed.  In the second part (Chapters 5 and 6), extensive MC studies are carried out, but the main goal is the simultaneous estimation of states and fixed model parameters for chosen non-standard dynamic models. This area of research is still very active and it is within this area where this thesis contributes themost. Chapter 5 provides a partial survey of particle filter variants used to conduct the simultaneous estimation of states and fixed parameters. Such filters are an extension of those previously adopted for estimating solely the states. Additionally, a MC study is carried out to estimate the state (level) and the two fixed variance parameters of the non-stationary local level model; we use four particle filter variants (LW, SIRJ, SIRoptJ, KPFJ), six typical settings of the SNR and two settings for the discount factor needed in the jittering step. In this chapter, the SIRJ particle filter variant is proposed as an alternative to the well-established filter of Liu West (LW PF). The combined use of a Kalman-based proposal distribution and a jittering step is proposed and explored, which gives rise to the particle filter variant called: the Kalman Particle Filter plus Jittering (KPFJ). Chapter 6 focuses on estimating the states and three fixed parameters of the non-standard basic stochastic volatility model known as stochastic autoregressive volatility model of order one: SARV(1). After an introduction and detailed description of the stylized features of financial  time series, the estimation ability of two competing particle filter variants (SIRJ vs LW(Liu andWest)) is shown empirically using simulated data. The chapter ends with an application to real data sets from the financial area: the Spanish IBEX 35 returns index and the Europe Brent Spot prices (in dollars).  The contribution in chapters 5 and 6 is to propose new variants of particle filters, such as the KPFJ, the SIRJ, and the SIRoptJ (a special case of the SIRJ that uses an optimal proposal distribution) that have developed along this work. The thesis also suggests that the so-called EPFJ (Extended Particle Filter with Jittering) and the UPFJ (Unscented Particle Filter with Jittering) algorithms could be reasonable choices when dealingwith highly nonlinearmodels. In this part, also relevant issueswithin the particle filteringmethodology are discussed, such as the potential impact on estimation of the discount factor parameter, the time series length, and the number of particles used.  Throughout this work, pseudo-codes are written for all filters studied and are implemented in RLanguage. The reported findings are obtained as the result of extensive MC studies, considering a variety of case-scenarios described in the thesis. The intrinsic characteristics of the model at hand  guided -according to suitability– the choice of filters in each specific situation. The comparison of filters is based on the RMSE, the elapsed CPU-time and the degree of degeneracy.   Finally, Chapter 7 includes the discussion, contributions, and future lines of research. Some complementary theoretical and practical aspects are presented in the appendix.           L’estimació seqüencial dels estats (filtratge) i la corresponent estimació simultània dels estats i els paràmetres fixos d’unmodel dinàmic formulat en forma d’espai d’estat –sigui lineal o no– constitueix un problema de rellevada importància enmolts camps, com ser a l’àrea de finances.  L’objectiu principal d’aquesta tesi és el d’estimar seqüencialment i de manera eficient –des d’un punt de vista bayesià i usant lametodologia de filtratge de partícules– els estats i/o els paràmetres fixos d’unmodel d’espai d’estat dinàmic no estàndard: possiblement no lineal, no gaussià o no estacionari. El present treball consisteix de 7 capítols i s’organitza en dues parts. El Capítol 1 hi introdueix conceptes bàsics, lamotivació, el propòsit i l’estructura de la tesi.  La primera part d’aquesta tesi (capítols 2 a 4) se centra únicament en l’estimació dels estats. El Capítol 2 presenta una revisió exhaustiva dels algorismes més clàssics no basats en simulacions (KF, EKF, UKF2) i els basats en simulacions (SIS, SIR, ASIR, EPF, UPF). Per a aquests filtres, tots esmentats en la literatura, amés de descriure’ls detalladament, s’ha unificat la notació amb l’objectiu que aquesta sigui consistent i comparable entre els diferents algorismes implementats al llarg d’aquest treball. Els capítols 3 i 4 se centren en la realització d’estudis Monte Carlo (MC) extensos que confirmen l’eficiència de la metodologia de filtratge de partícules per estimar els estats latents d’un procés dinàmic formulat en forma d’espai d’estat, sigui lineal o no. Alguns estudis MC complementaris es duen a terme per avaluar diferents aspectes de la  metodologia de filtratge de partícules, com ser el problema de la degeneració, l’elecció de l’estratègia de remostreig, el nombre de partícules usades o la grandària de la sèrie temporal.  Específicament, el Capítol 3 il·lustra el comportament de la metodologia de filtratge de partícules en un context lineal i gaussià en comparació de l’òptim i exacte filtre de Kalman. La capacitat de filtratge de les quatre variants de filtre de partícules estudiades (SIR, SIRopt, ASIR, KPF;  l’últim sent un cas especial de l’algorisme EPF) es va avaluar sobre la base de dos processos de sèries temporals aparentment simples però importants: els anomenats Local Level Model (LLM) i el AR (1) plus noise, que són no estacionari i estacionari, respectivament. Aquest capítol estudia en profunditat temes rellevants dins de l’enfocament adoptat, coml’impacte en l’estimació de la relació entre el senyal i el soroll (SNR: signal-to-noise-ratio, en aquesta tesi), de la longitud de la sèrie temporal i del nombre de partícules. El Capítol 4 avalua i il·lustra el comportament de la metodologia de filtratge de partícules en un context no lineal. En concret, s’utilitza un model d’espai d’estat no lineal, no gaussià i no estacionari pres de la literatura per il·lustrar el comportament de quatre filtres de partícules (SIR, ASIR, EPF, UPF) en contraposició a dos filtres no basats en simulació ben coneguts (EKF, UKF). Aquí es comparen els esquemes de remostreig residual i estratificat i s’avalua l’efecte d’augmentar el nombre de partícules.  A la segona part (capítols 5 i 6), es duen a terme també estudis MC extensos, però ara l’objectiu principal és l’estimació simultània dels estats i paràmetres fixos de certsmodels seleccionats. Aquesta àrea de recerca segueix sentmolt activa i és on aquesta tesi hi contribueixmés. El Capítol 5 proveeix una revisió parcial dels mètodes per dur a terme l’estimació simultània dels estats i paràmetres fixos a través de la metodologia de filtratge de partícules. Aquests filtres són una extensió d’aquells adoptats anteriorment només per estimar els estats. Aquí es realitza un estudi MC  per estimar l’estat (nivell) i els dos paràmetres de variància del model LLM no estacionari; s’utilitzen quatre variants (LW, SIRJ, SIRoptJ, KPFJ) de filtre de partícules, sis escenaris típics del SNR i dos escenaris per a l’anomenat factor de descompte necessari en el pas de diversificació. En aquest capítol, es proposa la variant de filtre de partícules SIRJ (Sample Importance Resampling with Jittering) com a alternativa al filtre de referència de Liu iWest (LWPF). També es proposa i explora l’ús combinat d’una distribució d’importància basada en el filtre de Kalman i un pas de diversificació (jittering) que dóna lloc a la variant del filtre de partícules anomenada Kalman Particle Filteringwith Jittering (KPFJ). El Capítol 6 se centra en l’estimació dels estats i dels paràmetres fixos delmodel bàsic no estàndard de volatilitat estocàstica denominat Stochastic autoregressive model of order one: SARV (1). Després d’una introducció i descripció detallada de les característiques pròpies de sèries temporals financeres, es demostra mitjançant estudis MC la capacitat d’estimació de dues variants de filtre de partícules (SIRJ vs. LW(Liu iWest)) utilitzant dades simulades. El capítol acaba amb una aplicació a dos conjunts de dades reals dins de l’àrea financera: l’índex de rendiments espanyol IBEX 35 i els preus al comptat (en dòlars) del Brent europeu. La contribució en els capítols 5 i 6 consisteix en proposar noves variants de filtres de partícules, compoden ser el KPFJ, el SIRJ i el SIRoptJ (un cas especial de l’algorisme SIRJ utilitzant una distribució d’importància òptima) que s’han desenvolupat al llarg d’aquest treball. També se suggereix que els anomenats filtres de partícules EPFJ (Extended Particle Filter with Jittering) i UPFJ (Unscented Particle Filter with Jittering) podrien ser opcions raonables quan es tracta de models altament no lineals; el KPFJ sent un cas especial de l’algorisme EPFJ. En aquesta part, també es tracten aspectes rellevants dins de la metodologia de filtratge de partícules, com ser l’impacte potencial en l’estimació de la longitud de la sèrie temporal, el paràmetre de factor de descompte i el nombre de partícules.  Al llarg d’aquest treball s’han escrit (i implementat en el llenguatge R) els pseudo-codis per a tots els filtres estudiats. Els resultats presentats s’obtenenmitjançant simulacionsMonte Carlo (MC) extenses, tenint en compte variats escenaris descrits en la tesi. Les característiques intrínseques del model baix estudi van guiar l’elecció dels filtres a comparar en cada situació específica. Amés, la comparació dels filtres es basa en el RMSE (RootMean Square Error), el temps de CPU i el grau de degeneració.   Finalment, el Capítol 7 presenta la discussió, les contribucions i les línies futures de recerca. Alguns aspectes teòrics i pràctics complementaris es presenten en els apèndixs.           La estimación secuencial de los estados (filtrado) y la correspondiente estimación simultánea de los estados y los parámetros fijos de un modelo dinámico formulado en forma de espacio de estado –sea lineal o no– constituye un problema de relevada importancia enmuchos campos, como ser en el área de finanzas.  El objetivo principal de esta tesis es el de estimar secuencialmente y de manera eficiente –desde un punto de vista bayesiano y usando la metodología de filtrado de partículas– los estados y/o los parámetros fijos de un modelo de espacio de estado dinámico no estándar: posiblemente no lineal, no gaussiano o no estacionario. El presente trabajo consta de 7 capítulos y se organiza en dos partes. El Capítulo 1 introduce conceptos básicos, la motivación, el propósito y la estructura de la tesis.   La primera parte de esta tesis (capítulos 2 a 4) se centra únicamente en la estimación de los estados. El Capítulo 2 presenta una revisión exhaustiva de los algoritmos más clásicos no basados en simulaciones (KF, EKF,UKF3) y los basados en simulaciones (SIS, SIR, ASIR, EPF, UPF). Para todos estos filtros, mencionados en la literatura, además de describirlos en detalle, se ha unificado la notación con el objetivo  de que ésta sea consistente y comparable entre los diferentes algoritmos implementados a lo largo de este trabajo. Los capítulos 3 y 4 se centran en la realización de estudios Monte Carlo (MC) extensos que confirman la eficiencia de la metodología de filtrado de partículas para estimar los estados latentes de un proceso dinámico formulado en forma de espacio de estado, sea lineal o no. Algunos estudios MC complementarios se llevan a cabo para evaluar varios aspectos de la metodología de filtrado de partículas, como ser el problema de la degeneración, la elección de la estrategia de remuestreo, el número de partículas usadas o el tamaño de la serie temporal. Específicamente, el Capítulo 3 ilustra el comportamiento de lametodología de filtrado de partículas en un contexto lineal y gaussiano en comparación con el óptimo y exacto filtro de Kalman. La capacidad de filtrado de las cuatro variantes de filtro de partículas estudiadas (SIR, SIRopt, ASIR, KPF; el último siendo un caso especial del algoritmo EPF) se evaluó en base a dos procesos de series temporales aparentemente simples pero importantes: los denominados Local Level Model (LLM) y el AR (1) plus noise, que son no estacionario y estacionario, respectivamente. Este capítulo estudia en profundidad  temas relevantes dentro del enfoque adoptado, como el impacto en la estimación de la relación entre la señal y el ruido (SNR: signal-to-noise-ratio, en esta tesis), de la longitud de la serie temporal y del número de partículas. El Capítulo 4 evalúa e ilustra el comportamiento de la metodología de filtrado de partículas en un contexto no lineal. En concreto, se utiliza un modelo de espacio de estado no lineal, no gaussiano y no estacionario tomado de la literatura para ilustrar el comportamiento de cuatro filtros de partículas (SIR, ASIR, EPF, UPF) en contraposición a dos filtros no basados en simulación bien conocidos (EKF, UKF). Aquí se comparan los esquemas de remuestreo residual y estratificado y se evalúa el efecto de  aumentar el número de partículas.  En la segunda parte (capítulos 5 y 6), se llevan a cabo también estudios MC extensos, pero ahora el objetivo principal es la estimación simultánea de los estados y parámetros fijos de ciertos modelos seleccionados. Esta área de investigación sigue siendo muy activa y es donde esta tesis contribuye más. El Capítulo 5 provee una revisión parcial de losmétodos para llevar a cabo la estimación simultánea de los estados y parámetros fijos a través de lametodología de filtrado de partículas. Dichos filtros son una extensión de aquellos adoptados anteriormente sólo para estimar los estados. Aquí se realiza un estudio MC para estimar el estado (nivel) y los dos parámetros de varianza del modelo LLM no estacionario; se utilizan cuatro variantes (LW, SIRJ, SIRoptJ, KPFJ) de filtro de partículas, seis escenarios típicos del SNR y dos escenarios para el llamado factor de descuento necesario en el paso de diversificación. En este capítulo, se propone la variante de filtro de partículas SIRJ (Sample Importance  resampling with Jittering) como alternativa al filtro de referencia de Liu y West (LW PF). También se propone y explora el uso combinado de una distribución de importancia basada en el filtro de Kalman y un paso de diversificación (jittering) que da lugar a la variante del filtro de partículas denominada Kalman Particle Filteringwith Jittering (KPFJ). El Capítulo 6 se centra en la estimación de los estados y de los parámetros fijos del modelo básico no estándar de volatilidad estocástica denominado Stochastic autoregressivemodel of order one: SARV (1). Después de una introducción y descripción detallada de las características propias de series temporales financieras, se demuestra mediante estudios MC la capacidad de estimación de dos variantes de filtro de partículas (SIRJ vs. LW (Liu y West)) utilizando datos simulados. El capítulo termina con  una aplicación a dos conjuntos de datos reales dentro del área financiera: el índice de rendimientos español IBEX 35 y los precios al contado (en dólares) del Brent europeo. La contribución en los capítulos 5 y 6 consiste en proponer nuevas variantes de filtros de partículas, como pueden ser el KPFJ, el SIRJ y el SIRoptJ (Caso especial del algoritmo SIRJ utilizando una distribución de importancia óptima) que se han desarrollado a lo largo de este trabajo. También se sugiere que los llamados filtros de partículas EPFJ (Extended Particle Filter with Jittering) y UPFJ (Unscented  Particle Filter with Jittering) podrían ser opciones razonables cuando se trata de modelos altamente no lineales; el KPFJ siendo un caso especial del algoritmo EPFJ. En esta parte, también se tratan aspectos relevantes dentro de lametodología de filtrado de partículas, como ser el impacto potencial en la estimación de la longitud de la serie temporal, el parámetro de factor de descuento y el número de partículas.  A lo largo de este trabajo se han escrito (e implementado en el lenguaje R) los pseudo-códigos para todos los filtros estudiados. Los resultados presentados se obtienen mediante simulaciones Monte Carlo (MC) extensas, teniendo en cuenta variados escenarios descritos en la tesis. Las características intrínsecas del modelo bajo estudio guiaron la elección de los filtros a comparar en cada situación específica. Además, la comparación de los filtros se basa en el RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), el tiempo de CPU y el grado de degeneración.  Finalmente, el Capítulo 7 presenta la discusión, las contribuciones y las líneas futuras de investigación. Algunos aspectos teóricos y prácticos complementarios se presentan en los apéndices.},

  abstract = {Dynamical systems with random influences occur throughout the physical, biological, and social sciences. By carefully studying a randomly varying system over a small time interval, a discrete stochastic process model can be constructed. Next, letting the time interval shrink to zero, an Ito stochastic differential equation model for the dynamical system is obtained. This modeling procedure is thoroughly explained and illustrated for randomly varying systems in population biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and finance. Introductory chapters present the fundamental concepts of random variables, stochastic processes, stochastic integration, and stochastic differential equations. These concepts are explained in a Hilbert space setting which unifies and simplifies the presentation. Computer programs, given throughout the text, are useful in solving representative stochastic problems. Analytical and computational exercises are provided in each chapter that complement the material in the text. Modeling with Itô Stochastic Differential Equations is useful for researchers and graduate students. As a textbook for a graduate course, prerequisites include probability theory, differential equations, intermediate analysis, and some knowledge of scientific programming},

  abstract = {The estimation of static parameters in general non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models is a long-standing problem. This is despite the advent of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC, aka particle filters) methods, which provide very good approximations to the optimal filter under weak assumptions. Several algorithms based on SMC have been proposed in the past 10 years to solve the static parameter problem. However all the algorithms we are aware of suffer from the so-called ‘degeneracy problem’. We propose here a methodology for point estimation of static parameters which does not suffer from this problem. Our methods take advantage of the fact that many state space models of interest are ergodic and stationary: this allows us to propose contrast functions for the static parameter which can be consistently estimated and optimised using simulation-based methods. Several types of contrast functions are possible but we focus here on the average of a so-called pseudo-likelihood which we maximize using on-line Expectation-Maximization type algorithms. In its basic form the algorithm requires the expression of the invariant distribution of the underlying state process. When the invariant distribution is unknown, we present an alternative which relies on indirect inference techniques.},

  abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are the two most popular classes of algorithms used to sample from general high-dimensional probability distributions. The theoretical convergence of MCMC algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, but their practical performance is notoriously unsatisfactory when the proposal distributions used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to systematically design potentially very efficient high-dimensional proposal distributions for MCMC by using SMC techniques. We demonstrate how this novel approach allows us to design effective MCMC algorithms in complex scenarios. This is illustrated by a problem of Bayesian inference for a stochastic kinetic model.},

  abstract = {Summary             Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability distributions. Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a Lévy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

  abstract = {Estimating and quantifying uncertainty in unknown system parameters from limited data remains a challenging inverse problem in a variety of real-world applications. While many approaches focus on estimating constant parameters, a subset of these problems includes time-varying parameters with unknown evolution models that often cannot be directly observed. This work develops a systematic particle filtering approach that reframes the idea behind artificial parameter evolution to estimate time-varying parameters in nonstationary inverse problems arising from deterministic dynamical systems. Focusing on systems modeled by ordinary differential equations, we present two particle filter algorithms for time-varying parameter estimation: one that relies on a fixed value for the noise variance of a parameter random walk; another that employs online estimation of the parameter evolution noise variance along with the time-varying parameter of interest. Several computed examples demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithms in estimating time-varying parameters with different underlying functional forms and different relationships with the system states (i.e., additive vs. multiplicative).},

Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or “particle”) representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example.},

The virus spreads through contaminated air particles, fomite, and surface-contaminated porous (i.e., paper, wood, and masks) and non-porous (i.e., plastic, stainless steel, and glass) materials. The persistence of viruses on materials depends on porosity, adsorption, evaporation, isoelectric point, and environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, and relative humidity. Disinfection techniques are crucial for preventing viral contamination on animated and inanimate surfaces. Currently, there are few effective methodologies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses without any side effects. Before infection can occur, measures must be taken to prevent the persistence of the coronavirus on the surfaces of both porous and non-porous inanimate materials. This review focuses on coronavirus persistence in surface materials (inanimate) and control measures. Viruses are inactivated through chemical and physical methods; the chemical methods particularly include alcohol, chlorine, and peroxide, whereas temperature, pH, humidity, ultraviolet irradiation (UV), gamma radiation, X-rays, ozone, and non-thermal, plasmagenerated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are physical methods.},

  abstract = {Stochastic differential equations provide a powerful tool for modelling dynamic phenomena affected by random noise. In case of repeated observations of time series for several experimental units, it is often the case that some of the parameters vary between the individual experimental units, which has motivated a considerable interest in stochastic differential equations with mixed effects, where a subset of the parameters are random. These models enable simultaneous representation of randomness in the dynamics and variability between experimental units. When the data are observations at discrete time points, the likelihood function is only rarely explicitly available, so for likelihood-based inference to be feasible, numerical methods are needed. We present Gibbs samplers and stochastic EM-algorithms based on augmented data obtained by the simple method for simulation of diffusion bridges in Bladt and Sørensen (2014). This method is easy to implement and has no tuning parameters. The method is, moreover, computationally efficient at low sampling frequencies because the computing time increases linearly with the time between observations. The algorithms can be extended to models with measurement errors. The Gibbs sampler as well as the EM-algorithm are shown to simplify considerably for exponential families of diffusion processes, including many models used in practice. In a simulation study, the estimation methods are shown to work well for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and t-diffusions with mixed effects. Finally, the Gibbs sampler is applied to neuronal data.},

This perturbation allows us to obtain a set of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that still have the conservation law. Afterward, by using Girsanov’s Theorem, we calculate the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for parameters that represent the symptomatic infection rate, asymptomatic infection rate, and the proportion of symptomatic individuals. These parameters are crucial to obtain information about the dynamic of the disease. We prove the consistency of the MLE for a fixed time observation window, in which the disease is in its growth phase. The proposed stochastic SEIR model improves the uncertainty quantification of an overestimated MCMC scheme based on its deterministic model to count reported-confirmed COVID-19 cases of Mexico City. Using a particular mechanism to manage missing data, we developed MLE for some parameters of the stochastic model that improves the description of variance of the actual data.},

For estimating the diffusion parameter, we use the MLE for two cases and the quadratic variation of the data for one of the SDEs. We apply the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to choose the best model for the simulated data. We consider that the AIC is a function of the drift parameter.

Reduced form regression estimates that flexibly control for time trends suggest that globally, a 10 percentage point reduction in mobility is associated with a 0.05–0.07 reduction in the value of the effective reproduction number, R(t). However, the strength of the association varies substantially across world regions and over time, being initially positive and strong in most world regions during the 2020 spring period, but becoming weaker over the summer, especially in Europe and Asia. We further find evidence that the strength of the association between mobility and transmission rates is reduced where facial coverings rules were implemented.},

The authors focus on developing context and intuition before formalizing the theory of each topic, illustrated with examples. After a review of some background material, the reader is introduced to semigroup theory, including the Hille-Yosida Theorem, used to construct continuous parameter Markov processes. Illustrated with examples, it is a cornerstone of Feller’s seminal theory of the most general one-dimensional diffusions studied in a later chapter. This is followed by two chapters with probabilistic constructions of jump Markov processes, and processes with independent increments, or Lévy processes. The greater part of the book is devoted to Itô’s fascinating theory of stochastic differential equations, and to the study of asymptotic properties of diffusions in all dimensions, such as explosion, transience, recurrence, existence of steady states, and the speed of convergence to equilibrium. A broadly applicable functional central limit theorem for ergodic Markov processes is presented with important examples. Intimate connections between diffusions and linear second order elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations are laid out in two chapters, and are used for computational purposes. Among Special Topics chapters, two study anomalous diffusions: one on skew Brownian motion, and the other on an intriguing multi-phase homogenization of solute transport in porous media},

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) like lockdowns and curfews have been deployed by affected countries for controlling the spread of infections. In this paper, we develop a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) epidemic model for computing the optimal sequence of NPIs over a planning horizon, considering shortages in doctors and hospital beds, under three different lockdown scenarios. We analyse two strategies - centralised (homogeneous decisions at the national level) and decentralised (decisions differentiated across regions), for two objectives separately - minimization of infections and deaths, using actual pandemic data of France. We linearize the quadratic constraints and objective functions in the MINLP model and convert it to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. A major result that we show analytically is that under the epidemic model used, the optimal sequence of NPIs always follows a decreasing severity pattern. Using this property, we further simplify the MILP model into an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, reducing computational time up to 99\%. Our numerical results show that a decentralised strategy is more effective in controlling infections for a given severity budget, yielding up to 20\% lesser infections, 15\% lesser deaths and 60\% lesser shortages in healthcare resources. These results hold without considering logistics aspects and for a given level of compliance of the population.},

  abstract = {We propose a way to model the underdetection of infected and removed individuals in a compartmental model for estimating the COVID-19 epidemic. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a stochastic SIR model, specified as a system of stochastic differential equations, to analyse data from the Italian COVID-19 epidemic. We find that a correct assessment of the amount of underdetection is important to obtain reliable estimates of the critical model parameters. The adaptation of the model in each time interval between relevant government decrees implementing contagion mitigation measures provides short-term predictions and a continuously updated assessment of the basic reproduction number.},

These feedback effects from epidemiological conditions to inflows and from inflows to subsequent infections are underexplored to date. This study investigates the two-way relationship between mobility flows and COVID-19 cases in a context of unrestricted mobility without COVID-19 vaccines. To this end, we merge data on COVID-19 cases in Spain during the summer of 2020 at the province level with mobility records based on mobile position tracking. Using a control function approach, we find that a 1\% increase in arrivals translates into a 3.5\% increase in cases in the following week and 5.6\% ten days later. A simulation exercise shows the cases would have dropped by around 64\% if the Second State of Alarm had been implemented earlier.},

We present a Bayesian workflow for such models, including four features: (1) an adjustment for incomplete case ascertainment, (2) an adequate sampling distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases, (3) a flexible, time-varying transmission rate, and (4) a stratification by age group. Within the workflow, we benchmarked the performance of various implementations of two of these features (2 and 3). For the second feature, we used SARS-CoV-2 data from the canton of Geneva (Switzerland) and found that a quasi-Poisson distribution is the most suitable sampling distribution for describing the overdispersion in the observed laboratory-confirmed cases. For the third feature, we implemented three methods: Brownian motion, B-splines, and approximate Gaussian processes (aGP). We compared their performance in terms of the number of effective samples per second, and the error and sharpness in estimating the time-varying transmission rate over a selection of ordinary differential equation solvers and tuning parameters, using simulated seroprevalence and laboratory-confirmed case data.},

  abstract = {In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as new daily incidence and mortality data become available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate is dynamically changing, either because of a mutation of the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of of uncertainty in model parameter estimates, including the reproduction number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that plays the role of the basic reproduction number R0 of the model. When we apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the proposed reproduction number R0 to have a consistent dynamic behavior within both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the mitigation measures.},

  abstract = {As the threat of COVID-19 increases, many countries have carried out various nonpharmaceutical interventions. Although many studies have evaluated the impact of these interventions, there is a lack of mapping between model parameters and actual geographic areas. In this study, a non-pharmaceutical intervention model of COVID-19 based on a discrete grid is proposed from the perspective of geography. This model can provide more direct and effective information for the formulation of prevention and control policies. First, a multi-level grid was introduced to divide the geographical space, and the properties of the grid boundary were used to describe the quarantine status and intensity in these different spaces; this was also combined with the model of hospital isolation and self-protection. Then, a process for the spatiotemporal evolution of the early COVID-19 spread is proposed that integrated the characteristics of residents’ daily activities. Finally, the effect of the interventions was quantitatively analyzed by the dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. The results showed that quarantining is the most effective intervention, especially for infectious diseases with a high infectivity. The introduction of a quarantine could effectively reduce the number of infected humans, advance the peak of the maximum infected number of people, and shorten the duration of the pandemic. However, quarantines only function properly when employed at sufficient intensity; hospital isolation and self-protection measures can effectively slow the spread of COVID-19, thus providing more time for the relevant departments to prepare, but an outbreak will occur again when the hospital reaches full capacity. Moreover, medical resources should be concentrated in places where there is the most urgent need under a strict quarantine measure.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Determining the level of social distancing, quantified here as the reduction in~daily number of social contacts per person, i.e. the daily contact rate, needed to maintain control of the COVID-19 epidemic and not exceed acute bed capacity in case of future epidemic waves, is important for future planning of relaxing of strict social distancing measures. This work uses mathematical modelling to simulate the levels of COVID-19 in North East London (NEL) and inform the level of social distancing necessary to protect the public and the healthcare demand from future COVID-19 waves. We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model describing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in NEL, calibrated to data on hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospital discharges and in-hospital deaths in NEL during the first epidemic wave. To account for the uncertainty in both the infectiousness period and the proportion of symptomatic infection, we simulated nine scenarios for different combinations of infectiousness period (1, 3 and 5~days) and proportion of symptomatic infection (70\%, 50\% and 25\% of all infections). Across all scenarios, the calibrated model was used to assess the risk of occurrence and predict the strength and timing of a second COVID-19 wave under varying levels of daily contact rate from July 04, 2020. Specifically, the daily contact rate required to suppress the epidemic and prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and the daily contact rate required to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL system without any additional intervention measures after July 2020, were determined across the nine different scenarios. Our results caution against a full relaxing of the lockdown later in 2020, predicting that a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of social contact from July 04, 2020, would induce a second wave up to eight times the original wave. With different levels of ongoing social distancing, future resurgence can be avoided, or the strength of the resurgence can be mitigated. Keeping the daily contact rate lower than 5 or 6, depending on scenarios, can prevent an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, could keep the effective reproduction number R               e               below 1 and a secondary COVID-19 wave may be avoided in NEL. A daily contact rate between 6 and 7, across scenarios, is likely to increase R               e               above 1 and result in a secondary COVID-19 wave with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and associated deaths, but with demand for hospital-based care remaining within the bed capacity of the NEL health and care system. In contrast, an increase in daily contact rate above 8 to 9, depending on scenarios, will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in NEL and may potentially require additional lockdowns. This scenario is associated with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, and acute COVID-19 care demand is likely to require significant scaling down of the usual operation of the health and care system and should be avoided. Our findings suggest that to avoid future COVID-19 waves and to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL health and care system, maintaining social distancing in NEL is advised with a view to limiting the average number of social interactions in the population. Increasing the level of social interaction beyond the limits described in this work could result in future COVID-19 waves that will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in the system, and depending on the strength of the resurgence may require additional lockdown measures.},

Stochastic filtering theory is briefly reviewed with emphasis on nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering. Following the Bayesian statistics, different Bayesian filtering techniques are developed given different scenarios. Under linear quadratic Gaussian circumstance, the celebrated Kalman filter can be derived within the Bayesian framework. Optimal/suboptimal nonlinear filtering techniques are extensively investigated. In particular, we focus our attention on the Bayesian filtering approach based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the so-called particle filters. Many variants of the particle filter as well as their features (strengths and weaknesses) are discussed. Related theoretical and practical issues are addressed in detail. In addition, some other (new) directions on Bayesian filtering are also explored.},

The diffusions can potentially be nonstationary. Although our methods are sampling based, making use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to sample the posterior distribution of the relevant unknowns, our general strategies and details are different from previous work along these lines. The methods we develop are simple to implement and simulation efficient. Importantly, unlike previous methods, the performance of our technique is not worsened, in fact it improves, as the degree of latent augmentation is increased to reduce the bias of the Euler approximation. In addition, our method is not subject to a degeneracy that afflicts previous techniques when the degree of latent augmentation is increased. We also discuss issues of model choice, model checking and filtering. The techniques and ideas are applied to both simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {Background: In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, several countries adopted measures of social distancing to a different degree. For many countries, after successfully curbing the initial wave, lockdown measures were gradually lifted. In Belgium, such relief started on May 4th with phase 1, followed by several subsequent phases over the next few weeks. Methods: We analysed the expected impact of relaxing stringent lockdown measures taken according to the phased Belgian exit strategy. We developed a stochastic, data-informed, meta-population model that accounts for mixing and mobility of the age-structured population of Belgium. The model is calibrated to daily hospitalization data and is able to reproduce the outbreak at the national level. We consider different scenarios for relieving the lockdown, quantified in terms of relative reductions in pre-pandemic social mixing and mobility. We validate our assumptions by making comparisons with social contact data collected during and after the lockdown. Results: Our model is able to successfully describe the initial wave of COVID-19 in Belgium and identifies interactions during leisure/other activities as pivotal in the exit strategy. Indeed, we find a smaller impact of school re-openings as compared to restarting leisure activities and re-openings of work places. We also assess the impact of case isolation of new (suspected) infections, and find that it allows re-establishing relatively more social interactions while still ensuring epidemic control. Scenarios predicting a second wave of hospitalizations were not observed, suggesting that the per-contact probability of infection has changed with respect to the pre-lockdown period. Conclusions: Contacts during leisure activities are found to be most influential, followed by professional contacts and school contacts, respectively, for an impending second wave of COVID-19. Regular re-assessment of social contacts in the population is therefore crucial to adjust to evolving behavioral changes that can affect epidemic diffusion.},

The choice of the proposal distribution is a major concern and can dramatically influence the quality of the estimates. Thus, we show how the long-used coefficient of variation (suggested by Kong et al. (1994)) of the weights can be used for estimating the chi-square distance between the target and instrumental distributions of the auxiliary particle filter. As a by-product of this analysis we obtain an auxiliary adjustment multiplier weight type for which this chi-square distance is minimal. Moreover, we establish an empirical estimate of linear complexity of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the involved distributions. Guided by these results, we discuss adaptive designing of the particle filter proposal distribution and illustrate the methods on a numerical example.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Many scientific fields have experienced growth in the use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), also known as diffusion processes, to model scientific phenomena over time. SDEs can simultaneously capture the known deterministic dynamics of underlying variables of interest (e.g., ocean flow, chemical and physical characteristics of a body of water, presence, absence, and spread of a disease), while enabling a modeler to capture the unknown random dynamics in a stochastic setting. We focus on reviewing a wide range of statistical inference methods for likelihood‐based frequentist and Bayesian parametric inference based on discretely‐sampled diffusions. Exact parametric inference is not usually possible because the transition density is not available in closed form. Thus, we review the literature on approximate numerical methods (e.g., Euler, Milstein, local linearization, and Aït‐Sahalia) and simulation‐based approaches (e.g., data augmentation and exact sampling) that are used to carry out parametric statistical inference on SDE processes. We close with a brief discussion of other methods of inference for SDEs and more complex SDE processes such as spatio‐temporal SDEs.

The key component of a particle filter is a set of particles with importance weights that serve as a proxy of the true posterior distribution of some stochastic process. In this work, we propose continuous latent particle filters, an approach that extends particle filtering to the continuous-time domain. We demonstrate how continuous latent particle filters can be used as a generic plug-in replacement for inference techniques relying on a learned variational posterior. Our experiments with different model families based on latent neural stochastic differential equations demonstrate superior performance of continuous-time particle filtering in inference tasks like likelihood estimation and sequential prediction for a variety of stochastic processes.},

  abstract = {In the absence of sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19, a substantial number of infecteds are expected to remain undetected. Since the undetected cases are not quarantined, they can be expected to transmit the infection at a much higher rate than their quarantined counterparts. That is, in the absence of extensive random testing, the actual prevalence and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection can be significantly higher than that being reported. Thus, it is imperative that the information on the percentage of undetected (or unreported) cases be incorporated in the mechanism for estimating the key epidemiological parameters, like rate of transmission, rate of recovery, reproduction rate, etc., and hence, for forecasting the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. In this paper, we have developed a new dynamic version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to assimilate the impact of the time-varying proportion of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from the Gibbs sampling procedure.},

However, this approach requires the use of special particle filtering techniques which suffer from several drawbacks.

An original particle method is presented to implement these approaches and their efficiency is assessed through simulation.},

  abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is a powerful technique originally developed for particle filtering and Bayesian inference. As a generic optimizer for statistical and nonstatistical objectives, its role is far less known. Density-tempered SMC is a highly efficient sampling technique ideally suited for challenging global optimization problems and is implementable with a somewhat arbitrary initialization sampler instead of relying on a prior distribution. SMC optimization is anchored at the fact that all optimization tasks (continuous, discontinuous, combinatorial, or noisy objective function) can be turned into sampling under a density or probability function short of a norming constant. The point with the highest functional value is the SMC estimate for the maximum. Through examples, we systematically present various density-tempered SMC algorithms and their superior performance vs. other techniques like Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Data cloning and k-fold duplication are two easily implementable accuracy accelerators, and their complementarity is discussed. The Extreme Value Theorem on the maximum order statistic can also help assess the quality of the SMC optimum. Our coverage includes the algorithmic essence of the density-tempered SMC with various enhancements and solutions for (1) a bi-modal nonstatistical function without and with constraints, (2) a multidimensional step function, (3) offline and online optimizations, (4) combinatorial variable selection, and (5) noninvertibility of the Hessian.},

Methods: We conducted a rapid mapping review (search date: 1 March 2023) to identify primary studies reporting on the effectiveness of NPIs to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Included studies were displayed in an interactive evidence gap map. Results: After removal of duplicates, 11 752 records were screened. Of these, 151 were included, including 100 modelling studies but only 2 randomized controlled trials and 10 longitudinal observational studies. Most studies reported on NPIs to identify and isolate those who are or may become infectious, and on NPIs to reduce the number of contacts. There was an evidence gap for hand and respiratory hygiene, ventilation and cleaning. Conclusions: Our findings show that despite the large number of studies published, there is still a lack of robust evaluations of the NPIs implemented in the UK. There is a need to build evaluation into the design and implementation of public health interventions and policies from the start of any future pandemic or other public health emergency.},

  abstract = {The particle filter was popularized in the early 1990s and has been used for solving estimation problems ever since. The standard algorithm can be understood and implemented with limited effort due to the widespread availability of tutorial material and code examples. Extensive research has advanced the standard particle filter algorithm to improve its performance and applicability in various ways in the years after. As a result, selecting and implementing an advanced version of the particle filter that goes beyond the standard algorithm and fits a specific estimation problem requires either a thorough understanding or reviewing large amounts of the literature. The latter can be heavily time consuming especially for those with limited hands-on experience. Lack of implementation details in theory-oriented papers complicates this task even further. The goal of this tutorial is facilitating the reader to familiarize themselves with the key concepts of advanced particle filter algorithms and to select and implement the right particle filter for the estimation problem at hand. It acts as a single entry point that provides a theoretical overview of the filter, its assumptions and solutions for various challenges encountered when applying particle filters. Besides that, it includes a running example that demonstrates and implements many of the challenges and solutions.},

We investigate the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and hospitalization or the length of stay (LoS) in the hospital, and whether there are differences in the population. Sciensano collected information on 14,618 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admissions from 114 Belgian hospitals between 14 March and 12 June 2020. The distributions of different event times for different patient groups are estimated accounting for interval censoring and right truncation of the time intervals. The time between symptom onset and hospitalization or diagnosis are similar, with median length between symptom onset and hospitalization ranging between 3 and 10.4 days, depending on the age of the patient (longest delay in age group 20–60 years) and whether or not the patient lives in a nursing home (additional 2 days for patients from nursing home). The median LoS in hospital varies between 3 and 10.4 days, with the LoS increasing with age. The hospital LoS for patients that recover is shorter for patients living in a nursing home, but the time to death is longer for these patients. Over the course of the first wave, the LoS has decreased.},

  abstract = {Highly non-linear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in fields such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases often display highly non-linear dynamics. However, such models are problematic from the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are two main classes of methods for circumventing these difficulties: information reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic Likelihood and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to compare the methods, in order to reach conclusions about how to approach inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model mis-specification, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem but, under the correct model and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different methods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning requirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to a state space method, checking results against the information reduction approach.},

Our work removes the strong conditions imposed by the EA and thus extends significantly the class of discretisation error-free MC methods for diffusions. The reason that CIS can be applied more generally than EA is that it no longer works on the path space of the SDE. Instead it uses proposal distributions for the transition density of the diffusion, and proposal distributions that are absolutely continuous with respect to the true transition density exist for general SDEs.},

If forecasts are generated from mechanistic models, they can be further used to target resources or to compare the impact of possible interventions. However, paremeterising such models is often difficult in real time, when information on behavioural changes, interventions and routes of transmission are not readily available. Here, we present a semi-mechanistic model of infectious disease dynamics that was used in real time during the 2013–2016 West African Ebola epidemic, and show fits to a Ebola Forecasting Challenge conducted in late 2015 with simulated data mimicking the true epidemic. We assess the performance of the model in different situations and identify strengths and shortcomings of our approach. Models such as the one presented here which combine the power of mechanistic models with the flexibility to include uncertainty about the precise outbreak dynamics may be an important tool in combating future outbreaks.},

Our fit suggests a recovery period of 11.6 days and a reproduction ratio (R0) equal to 6.5. By calculating the correlation coefficient (r) between the real data and the theoretical points, our results suggest that the fractal model presents a higher r compared to the standard or fractional case. The fractal formulation is improved when two different fractal orders with distinguishing weights are considered. This modification in the model provides a better description of the data and improves the correlation coefficient.},

  abstract = {The number of resident space objects is rising at an alarming rate. Mega-constellations and breakup events are proliferating in most orbital regimes, and safe navigation is becoming increasingly problematic. It is important to be able to track RSOs accurately and at an affordable computational cost. Orbital dynamics are highly nonlinear, and current operational methods assume Gaussian representations of the objects’ states and employ linearizations which cease to hold true in observation-free propagation. Monte Carlo-based filters can provide a means to approximate the a posteriori probability distribution of the states more accurately by providing support in the portion of the state space which overlaps the most with the processed observations. Moreover, dynamical models are not able to capture the full extent of realistic forces experienced in the near-Earth space environment, and hence fully deterministic propagation methods may fail to achieve the desired accuracy. By modeling orbital dynamics as a stochastic system and solving it using stochastic numerical integrators, we are able to simultaneously estimate the scale of the process noise incurred by the assumed uncertainty in the system, and robustly track the state of the spacecraft. In order to find an adequate balance between accuracy and computational cost, we propose three algorithms which are capable of tracking a space object and estimating the magnitude of the system’s uncertainty. The proposed filters are successfully applied to a LEO scenario, demonstrating the ability to accurately track a spacecraft state and estimate the scale of the uncertainty online, in various simulation setups.},

Since several types and grades of actions were adopted by the governments, including travel restrictions, social distancing, or limitation of movement, we want to investigate how these measures can affect the epidemic curve of the infectious population. The parameters of interest for the SEIR model were estimated employing a composite likelihood approach. Moreover, standard errors have been corrected for temporal dependence. The adoption of restrictive measures results in flatten epidemic curves, and the future evolution indicated a decrease in the number of cases.},

We extend the classic SIR model by introducing nonlinear stochastic transmission, to get a stochastic SIR model. We derive its exact solution and discuss the condition for herd immunity. The stochastic SIR model corresponds to a population of infinite size. When the population size is finite, there is also sampling uncertainty. We propose a state-space framework under which we analyze the relative magnitudes of the observational and stochastic epidemiological uncertainties during the evolution of the epidemic. We also emphasize the lack of robustness of the notion of herd immunity when the SIR model is time discretized.},

  abstract = {One misconception (of many) about Bayesian analyses is that prior distributions introduce assumptions that are more questionable than assumptions made by frequentist methods; yet the assumptions in priors can be more reasonable than the assumptions implicit in standard frequentist models. Another misconception is that Bayesian methods are computationally difficult and require special software. But perfectly adequate Bayesian analyses can be carried out with common software for frequentist analysis. Under a wide range of priors, the accuracy of these approximations is just as good as the frequentist accuracy of the software—and more than adequate for the inaccurate observational studies found in health and social sciences. An easy way to do Bayesian analyses is via inversevariance (information) weighted averaging of the prior with the frequentist estimate. A more general method expresses the prior distributions in the form of prior data or ‘data equivalents’, which are then entered in the analysis as a new data stratum. That form reveals the strength of the prior judgements being introduced and may lead to tempering of those judgements. It is argued that a criterion for scientific acceptability of a prior distribution is that it be expressible as prior data, so that the strength of prior assumptions can be gauged by how much data they represent.},

  abstract = {Parameter estimation for infectious disease models is important for basic understanding (e.g. to identify major transmission pathways), for forecasting emerging epidemics, and for designing control measures. Differential equation models are often used, but statistical inference for differential equations suffers from numerical challenges and poor agreement between observational data and deterministic models. Accounting for these departures via stochastic model terms requires full specification of the probabilistic dynamics, and computationally demanding estimation methods. Here, we demonstrate the utility of an alternative approach, generalized profiling, which provides robustness to violations of a deterministic model without needing to specify a complete probabilistic model. We introduce novel means for estimating the robustness parameters and for statistical inference in this framework. The methods are applied to a model for pre-vaccination measles incidence in Ontario, and we demonstrate the statistical validity of our inference through extensive simulation. The results confirm that school term versus summer drives seasonality of transmission, but we find no effects of short school breaks and the estimated basic reproductive ratio               ℛ               0               greatly exceeds previous estimates. The approach applies naturally to any system for which candidate differential equations are available, and avoids many challenges that have limited Monte Carlo inference for state–space models.},

We present a method for likelihood-based estimation of parameters in the stochastic SIR model under a time-inhomogeneous transmission rate comprised of piecewise constant components. In doing so, our method simultaneously learns change points in the transmission rate via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The method targets the exact model posterior in a difficult missing data setting given only partially observed case counts over time.

Despite the successes of non-parametric inference and neural-network-based inference for empirical modelling, a physical interpretation of the results often remains challenging. Here, we focus on direct inference of governing differential equations from data, which can be formulated as a linear inverse problem. A Bayesian framework with a Laplacian prior distribution is employed for finding sparse solutions efficiently. The superior accuracy and robustness of the method is demonstrated for various cases, including ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we develop an active learning procedure for the automated discovery of stochastic differential equations. In this procedure, learning of the unknown dynamical equations is coupled to the application of perturbations to the measured system in a feedback loop. We show that active learning can significantly improve the inference of global models for systems with multiple energetic minima.},

We introduce a novel method for accelerating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling by pairing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a diffusion model that can draw global samples with the aim of approximating the posterior. We briefly review diffusion models in the context of image synthesis before providing a streamlined diffusion model tailored towards low-dimensional data arrays. We then present our adapted Metropolis-Hastings algorithm which combines local proposals with global proposals taken from a diffusion model that is regularly trained on the samples produced during the MCMC run. Our approach leads to a significant reduction in the number of likelihood evaluations required to obtain an accurate representation of the Bayesian posterior across several analytic functions, as well as for a physical example based on a global analysis of parton distribution functions. Our method is extensible to other MCMC techniques, and we briefly compare our method to similar approaches based on normalizing flows.

  abstract = {Significance             Many scientific challenges involve the study of stochastic dynamic systems for which only noisy or incomplete measurements are available. Inference for partially observed Markov process models provides a framework for formulating and answering questions about these systems. Except when the system is small, or approximately linear and Gaussian, state-of-the-art statistical methods are required to make efficient use of available data. Evaluation of the likelihood for a partially observed Markov process model can be formulated as a filtering problem. Iterated filtering algorithms carry out repeated Monte Carlo filtering operations to maximize the likelihood. We develop a new theoretical framework for iterated filtering and construct a new algorithm that dramatically outperforms previous approaches on a challenging inference problem in disease ecology.           ,              Iterated filtering algorithms are stochastic optimization procedures for latent variable models that recursively combine parameter perturbations with latent variable reconstruction. Previously, theoretical support for these algorithms has been based on the use of conditional moments of perturbed parameters to approximate derivatives of the log likelihood function. Here, a theoretical approach is introduced based on the convergence of an iterated Bayes map. An algorithm supported by this theory displays substantial numerical improvement on the computational challenge of inferring parameters of a partially observed Markov process.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems are widely used to model systems across the sciences and engineering. Such models are natural to formulate and can be analyzed mathematically and numerically. However, difficulties associated with inference from time-series data about unknown parameters in these models have been a constraint on their application. We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh. We construct confidence intervals, perform residual analysis, and apply other diagnostics. Our analysis, based upon a model capturing the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of the system, reveals some effects overlooked by previous studies.},

  abstract = {Background: Lockdown measures are the backbone of containment measures for the COVID‑19 pandemic both in high‑income countries (HICs) and low‑ and middle‑income countries (LMICs). However, in view of the inevitably‑occurring second and third global covid‑19 wave, assessing the success and impact of containment measures on the epidemic curve of COVID‑19 and people’s compliance with such measures is crucial for more effective policies. To determine the containment measures influencing the COVID‑19 epidemic curve in nine targeted countries across high‑, middle‑, and low‑income nations. Methods: Four HICs (Germany, Sweden, Italy, and South Korea) and five LMICs (Mexico, Colombia, India, Nigeria, and Nepal) were selected to assess the association using interrupted time series analysis of daily case numbers and deaths of COVID‑19 considering the following factors: The “stringency index (SI)” indicating how tight the containment meas‑ures were implemented in each country; and the level of compliance with the prescribed measures using human mobility data. Additionally, a scoping review was conducted to contextualize the findings. Results: Most countries implemented quite rigorous lockdown measures, particularly the LMICs (India, Nepal, and Colombia) following the model of HICs (Germany and Italy). Exceptions were Sweden and South Korea, which opted for different strategies. The compliance with the restrictions—measured as mobility related to home office, restrain‑ing from leisure activities, non‑use of local transport and others—was generally good, except in Sweden and South Korea where the restrictions were limited. The endemic curves and time‑series analysis showed that the containment measures were successful in HICs but not in LMICs. Conclusion: The imposed lockdown measures are alarming, particularly in resource‑constrained settings where such measures are independent of the population segment, which drives the virus transmission. Methods for examining people’s movements or hardships that are caused by covid‑ no work, no food situation are inequitable. Novel and context‑adapted approach of dealing with the COVID‑19 crisis are therefore crucial.},

At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship provides an unprecedented opportunity to estimate its original transmissibility with basic reproductive number (R0) and the effectiveness of containment measures. We developed an ordinary differential equation-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with Bayesian underpinning to estimate the main parameter of R0 determined by transmission coefficients, incubation period, and the recovery rate. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method was used to tackle the parameters of uncertainty resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 given a small cohort of the cruise ship. The extended stratified SEIR model was also proposed to elucidate the heterogeneity of transmission route by the level of deck with passengers and crews. With the application of the overall model, R0 was estimated as high as 5.70 (95\% credible interval: 4.23–7.79). The entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 63\% (95\% credible interval: 60–66\%) infected passengers. With the deck-specific SEIR model, the heterogeneity of R0 estimates by each deck was noted. The estimated R0 figures were 5.18 for passengers (5–14 deck), mainly from the within-deck transmission, and 2.46 for crews (2–4 deck), mainly from the between-deck transmission. Modelling the dynamic of COVID-19 on the cruise ship not only provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine but also elucidates the relative contributions of different transmission modes on the cruise ship though the deck-stratified SEIR model.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 transmission models have conferred great value in informing public health understanding, planning, and response. However, the pandemic also demonstrated the infeasibility of basing public health decision-making on transmission models with pre-set assumptions. No matter how favourably evidenced when built, a model with fixed assumptions is challenged by numerous factors that are difficult to predict. Ongoing planning associated with rolling back and re-instituting measures, initiating surge planning, and issuing public health advisories can benefit from approaches that allow state estimates for transmission models to be continuously updated in light of unfolding time series. A model being continuously regrounded by empirical data in this way can provide a consistent, integrated depiction of the evolving underlying epidemiology and acute care demand, offer the ability to project forward such a depiction in a fashion suitable for triggering the deployment of acute care surge capacity or public health measures, and support quantitative evaluation of tradeoffs associated with prospective interventions in light of the latest estimates of the underlying epidemiology. We describe here the design, implementation, and multi-year daily use for public health and clinical support decision-making of a particle-filtered COVID-19 compartmental model, which served Canadian federal and provincial governments via regular reporting starting in June 2020. The use of the Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo algorithm of particle filtering allows the model to be regrounded daily and adapt to new trends within daily incoming data—including test volumes and positivity rates, endogenous and travel-related cases, hospital census and admissions flows, daily counts of dose-specific vaccinations administered, measured concentration of SARS-CoV2 in wastewater, and mortality. Important model outputs include estimates (via sampling) of the count of undiagnosed infectives, the count of individuals at different stages of the natural history of frankly and pauci-symptomatic infection, the current force of infection, effective reproductive number, and current and cumulative infection prevalence. Following a brief description of the model design, we describe how the machine learning algorithm of particle filtering is used to continually reground estimates of the dynamic model state, support a probabilistic model projection of epidemiology and health system capacity utilization and service demand, and probabilistically evaluate tradeoffs between potential intervention scenarios. We further note aspects of model use in practice as an effective reporting tool in a manner that is parameterized by jurisdiction, including the support of a scripting pipeline that permits a fully automated reporting pipeline other than securityrestricted new data retrieval, including automated model deployment, data validity checks, and automatic post-scenario scripting and reporting. As demonstrated by this multi-year deployment of the Bayesian machine learning algorithm of particle filtering to provide industrial-strength reporting to inform public health decision-making across Canada, such methods offer strong support for evidence-based public health decision-making informed by ever-current articulated transmission models whose probabilistic state and parameter estimates are continually regrounded by diverse data streams.},

In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review synthesizes empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures. Results: We identified 12 studies reporting social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight studies were conducted in European countries and eleven collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2 and 5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates, which ranged from 7 to 26 contacts per day. This reduction was pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults. Conclusion: Information on changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures can guide more realistic representations of contact patterns in mathematical models for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Statistical signal processing applications usually require the estimation of some parameters of interest given a set of observed data. These estimates are typically obtained either by solving a multi-variate optimization problem, as in the maximum likelihood (ML) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators, or by performing a multi-dimensional integration, as in the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimators. Unfortunately, analytical expressions for these estimators cannot be found in most real-world applications, and the Monte Carlo (MC) methodology is one feasible approach. MC methods proceed by drawing random samples, either from the desired distribution or from a simpler one, and using them to compute consistent estimators. The most important families of MC algorithms are the Markov chain MC (MCMC) and importance sampling (IS). On the one hand, MCMC methods draw samples from a proposal density, building then an ergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the desired distribution by accepting or rejecting those candidate samples as the new state of the chain. On the other hand, IS techniques draw samples from a simple proposal density and then assign them suitable weights that measure their quality in some appropriate way. In this paper, we perform a thorough review of MC methods for the estimation of static parameters in signal processing applications. A historical note on the development of MC schemes is also provided, followed by the basic MC method and a brief description of the rejection sampling (RS) algorithm, as well as three sections describing many of the most relevant MCMC and IS algorithms, and their combined use. Finally, five numerical examples (including the estimation of the parameters of a chaotic system, a localization problem in wireless sensor networks and a spectral analysis application) are provided in order to demonstrate the performance of the described approaches.},

The SIR model is one of the fundamental methods to see the behavior of the pandemic with easy computation. However, there are no stochastic variation in the equations. The stochastic differential equations (SDE) can provide such kind of variations. Although the SDE are applied to many fields such as economics, less attention has been paid to the SIR simulations.

  abstract = {nimble is an R package for constructing algorithms and conducting inference on hierarchical models. The nimble package provides a unique combination of flexible model specification and the ability to program model-generic algorithms. Specifically, the package allows users to code models in the BUGS language, and it allows users to write algorithms that can be applied to any appropriate model. In this paper, we introduce nimble's capabilities for state-space model analysis using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques. We first provide an overview of state-space models and commonly-used SMC algorithms. We then describe how to build a state-space model and conduct inference using existing SMC algorithms within nimble. SMC algorithms within nimble currently include the bootstrap filter, auxiliary particle filter, ensemble Kalman filter, IF2 method of iterated filtering, and a particle MCMC sampler. These algorithms can be run in R or compiled into C++ for more efficient execution. Examples of applying SMC algorithms to linear autoregressive models and a stochastic volatility model are provided. Finally, we give an overview of how model-generic algorithms are coded within nimble by providing code for a simple SMC algorithm. This illustrates how users can easily extend nimble's SMC methods in high-level code.},

  abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods are a class of importance sampling and resampling techniques designed to simulate from a sequence of probability distributions. These approaches have become very popular over the last few years to solve sequential Bayesian inference problems (e.g. Doucet et al. 2001). However, in comparison to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the application of SMC remains limited when, in fact, such methods are also appropriate in such contexts (e.g. Chopin (2002); Del Moral et al. (2006)). In this paper, we present a simple unifying framework which allows us to extend both the SMC methodology and its range of applications. Additionally, reinterpreting SMC algorithms as an approximation of nonlinear MCMC kernels, we present alternative SMC and iterative self-interacting approximation (Del Moral and Miclo 2004; 2006) schemes. We demonstrate the performance of the SMC methodology on static and sequential Bayesian inference problems.},

However, in scenarios of target maneuverability, it is often necessary to update the parameters of the model to meet the changing conditions of the target. The novel aspect of the proposed approach lies in the estimation of non-static parameters which change at some unknown point in time. Our parameter estimation is updated using changepoint analysis, where a changepoint is identified when a significant change occurs in the observations of the system, such as changes in direction or velocity.},

The overall burden of influenza is captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influenza-like illness network, which provides invaluable information about the current incidence. This information is used to provide decision support regarding prevention and response efforts. Despite the relatively rich surveillance data and the recurrent nature of seasonal influenza, forecasting the timing and intensity of seasonal influenza in the U.S. remains challenging because the form of the disease transmission process is uncertain, the disease dynamics are only partially observed, and the public health observations are noisy. Fitting a probabilistic state-space model motivated by a deterministic mathematical model [a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model] is a promising approach for forecasting seasonal influenza while simultaneously accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. A significant finding of this work is the importance of thoughtfully specifying the prior, as results critically depend on its specification. Our conditionally specified prior allows us to exploit known relationships between latent SIR initial conditions and parameters and functions of surveillance data. We demonstrate advantages of our approach relative to alternatives via a forecasting comparison using several forecast accuracy metrics.},

We assume the disease-dynamic is described by a stochastic susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–susceptible (SEIRS) epidemic model, where the infected class is divided into the asymptomatic infected, and symptomatic infectious classes. Stochasticity appears in the model due to fluctuations in the disease’s transmission and recovery rates. The disease eradication threshold is derived from the reproduction number. The estimated parameters are used to model the disease outbreak’s possible trajectories. Our analysis reveals that current interventions are having positive effects on the transmission and recovery rates.

We find that a correct assessment of the amount of under-detection is important to obtain reliable estimates of the critical model parameters. Moreover, a single SIR model over the whole epidemic period is unable to correctly describe the behaviour of the pandemic. Then, the adaptation of the model in every time-interval between relevant government decrees that implement contagion mitigation measures, provides short-term predictions and a continuously updated assessment of the basic reproduction number.},

  abstract = {Modelling random dynamical systems in continuous time, diffusion processes are a powerful tool in many areas of science. Model parameters can be estimated from time-discretely observed processes using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that introduce auxiliary data. These methods typically approximate the transition densities of the process numerically, both for calculating the posterior densities and proposing auxiliary data. Here, the Euler–Maruyama scheme is the standard approximation technique. However, the MCMC method is computationally expensive. Using higher-order approximations may accelerate it, but the specific implementation and benefit remain unclear. Hence, we investigate the utilization and usefulness of higher-order approximations in the example of the Milstein scheme. Our study demonstrates that the MCMC methods based on the Milstein approximation yield good estimation results. However, they are computationally more expensive and can be applied to multidimensional processes only with impractical restrictions. Moreover, the combination of the Milstein approximation and the well-known modified bridge proposal introduces additional numerical challenges.},

Within a short period of time the outbreak developed exponentially into a pandemic that infected millions of people, with a global death toll of more than 500,000 during its first 6 months. Eventually, the novel disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the new virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to all known pandemics throughout history, COVID-19 has been accompanied by a large degree of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and economic disaster worldwide. Despite multiple publications and increasing knowledge regarding the biological secrets of SARS-CoV-2, as of the writing of this paper, there is neither an approved vaccine nor medication to prevent infection or cure for this highly infectious disease. Past pandemics were caused by a wide range of microbes, primarily viruses, but also bacteria. Characteristically, a significant proportion of them originated in different animal species (zoonoses). Since an understanding of the microbial cause of these diseases was unveiled relatively late in human history, past pandemics were often attributed to strange causes including punishment from God, demonic activity, or volatile unspecified substances.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistics provides a framework for the integration of dynamic models with incomplete data to enable inference of model parameters and unobserved aspects of the system under study. An important class of dynamic models is discrete state space, continuous-time Markov processes (DCTMPs). Simulated via the Doob–Gillespie algorithm, these have been used to model systems ranging from chemistry to ecology to epidemiology. A new type of proposal, termed ‘model-based proposal’ (MBP), is developed for the efficient implementation of Bayesian inference in DCTMPs using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This new method, which in principle can be applied to any DCTMP, is compared (using simple epidemiological SIS and SIR models as easy to follow exemplars) to a standard MCMC approach and a recently proposed particle MCMC (PMCMC) technique. When measurements are made on a single-state variable (e.g. the number of infected individuals in a population during an epidemic), model-based proposal MCMC (MBP-MCMC) is marginally faster than PMCMC (by a factor of 2–8 for the tests performed), and significantly faster than the standard MCMC scheme (by a factor of 400 at least). However, when model complexity increases and measurements are made on more than one state variable (e.g. simultaneously on the number of infected individuals in spatially separated subpopulations), MBP-MCMC is significantly faster than PMCMC (more than 100-fold for just four subpopulations) and this difference becomes increasingly large.},

We use this to perform batch and recursive maximum likelihood parameter estimation and tracking by maximizing the likelihood through a gradient ascent method.

Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.Funding statement: This work was partially supported by NIH grants P50GM76516 and R01GM107264 and NSF grants DMS1562176 and DMS1161621.

After a brief review and comparison of the performance of some heuristic approaches, the paper introduces three approaches including an optimization approach, a physics informed deep learning and a statistical inference method to estimate parameters and analyse disease transmission. The deep learning framework utilizes the hidden physics of infectious diseases and infer the latent quantities of interest in the model by approximating them using deep neural networks. The performance of the deep learning method is validated against representative small and big data sets corresponding to a well-known benchmark example and the results indicate that deep learning is a viable candidate to determine model parameters. The paper also presents the need for researchers to understand different types of dependencies exhibited in a typical data set and discovering the most appropriate approaches for statistical inference. Specifically, in this work we apply a time-series inferential method with a variety of statistical models. Our results indicate the efficiency and importance of statistical inference methods for researchers to understand and analyse time-series data to make confident predictions.},

Many of these results are proved using direct coupling constructions based on minorisation and drift conditions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Central Limit Theorems (CLTs) are also presented, in some cases proved via the Poisson Equation or direct regeneration constructions.

  abstract = {The SIS model is a fundamental model that helps to understand the spread of an infectious disease, in which infected individuals recover without immunity. Because of the random nature of infectious diseases, we can estimate the spread of a disease in population by stochastic models. In this article, we present a class of stochastic SIS model with births and deaths, obtained by superimposing Wiener processes (white noises) on contact and recovery rates and allowing variable diffusion rates. We prove existence of the unique, positive and bounded solution of this nonlinear system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and examine stochastic asymptotic stability of equilibria. In addition, we simulate the model by considering a numerical approximation based on a balanced implicit method (BIM) on an appropriately bounded domain D ⊂ R2.},

  abstract = {Background: Emerging infectious diseases pose a significant threat to global public health. Timely detection and response are crucial in mitigating the spread of such epidemics. Inferring the onset time and epidemiological characteristics is vital for accelerating early interventions, but accurately predicting these parameters in the early stages remains challenging. Methods: We introduce a Bayesian inference method to fit epidemic models to time series data based on state-space modeling, employing a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for transmission dynamics analysis. Our approach uses the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including the onset time, the transmission rate, and the recovery rate. The PMCMC algorithm integrates the advantageous aspects of both MCMC and particle filtering methodologies to yield a computationally feasible and effective means of approximating the likelihood function, especially when it is computationally intractable. Results: To validate the proposed method, we conduct case studies on COVID19 outbreaks in Wuhan, Shanghai and Nanjing, China, respectively. Using earlystage case reports, the PMCMC algorithm accurately predicted the onset time, key epidemiological parameters, and the basic reproduction number. These findings are consistent with empirical studies and the literature. Conclusion: This study presents a robust Bayesian inference method for the timely investigation of emerging infectious diseases. By accurately estimating the onset time and essential epidemiological parameters, our approach is versatile and efficient, extending its utility beyond COVID-19.},

By evaluating effects of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the research expects to provide references to other countries for formulating corresponding policies. This article divides all non-pharmaceutical interventions into three types according to their different roles. The results show that type-A and type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions both can delay the timing of large-scale infections of the susceptible population, timing of the number of exposed individuals to peak, and timing of peaking of the number of infected cases, as well as decrease the peak number of exposed cases. Moreover, type-B non-pharmaceutical interventions have more significant effects on susceptible and exposed populations. Type-C non-pharmaceutical interventions for improving the recovery rate of patients are able to effectively reduce the peak number of patients, greatly decrease the slope of the curve for the number of infected cases, substantially improve the recovery rate, and lower the mortality rate; however, these non-pharmaceutical interventions do not greatly delay the timing of the number of infected cases to peak. And based on the above analysis, we proposed some suggestions.},

However, traditional epidemiological models fail to capture the time-varying effects of mitigation strategies and do not account for under-reporting of active cases, thus introducing bias in the estimation of model parameters. To infer more accurate parameter estimates and to reduce the uncertainty of these estimates, we extend the SIR and SEIR epidemiological models with two time-varying parameters that capture the transmission rate and the rate at which active cases are reported to health officials. Using two real data sets of COVID-19 cases, we perform Bayesian inference via our SIR and SEIR models with time-varying transmission and reporting rates and via their standard counterparts with constant rates; our approach provides parameter estimates with more realistic interpretation, and 1-week ahead predictions with reduced uncertainty. Furthermore, we find consistent under-reporting in the number of active cases in the data that we consider, suggesting that the initial phase of the pandemic was more widespread than previously reported.},

  abstract = {This article develops a methodology allowing application of the complete machinery of particle-based inference methods upon what we call the class of continuous-discrete State Space Models (CD-SSMs). Such models correspond to a latent continuous-time Itˆo diffusion process which is observed with noise at discrete time instances. Due to the continuous-time nature of the hidden signal, standard Feynman-Kac formulations and their accompanying particle-based approximations have to overcome several challenges, arising mainly due to the following considerations: (i) finite-time transition densities of the signal are typically intractable; (ii) ancestors of sampled signals are determined w.p. 1, thus cannot be resampled; (iii) diffusivity parameters given a sampled signal yield Dirac distributions. We overcome all above issues by introducing a framework based on carefully designed proposals and transformations thereof. That is, we obtain new expressions for the Feynman-Kac model that accommodate the effects of a continuous-time signal and overcome induced degeneracies. The constructed formulations will enable use of the full range of particle-based algorithms for CD-SSMs: for filtering/smoothing and parameter inference, whether online or offline. Our framework is compatible with guided proposals in the filtering steps that are essential for efficient algorithmic performance in the presence of informative observations or in higher dimensions, and is applicable for a very general class of CD-SSMs, including the case when the signal is modelled as a hypo-elliptic diffusion. Our methods can be immediately incorporated to available software packages for particlebased algorithms.},

  abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has required most countries to implement complex sequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions, with the aim of controlling the transmission of the virus in the population. To be able to take rapid decisions, a detailed understanding of the current situation is necessary. Estimates of time-varying, instantaneous reproduction numbers represent a way to quantify the viral transmission in real time. They are often defined through a mathematical compartmental model of the epidemic, like a stochastic SEIR model, whose parameters must be estimated from multiple time series of epidemiological data. Because of very high dimensional parameter spaces (partly due to the stochasticity in the spread models) and incomplete and delayed data, inference is very challenging. We propose a state-space formalization of the model and a sequential Monte Carlo approach which allow to estimate a daily-varying reproduction number for the Covid-19 epidemic in Norway with sufficient precision, on the basis of daily hospitalization and positive test incidences. The method was in regular use in Norway during the pandemics and appears to be a powerful instrument for epidemic monitoring and management.},

The observer design method is based on positive definite matrices to parameterize a class of Lyapunov functionals, in order to stabilize the estimation error dynamics. Thus, the stability conditions can be expressed as a set of matrix inequality constraints which can be solved numerically using sum of squares (SOS) and standard semi-definite programming (SDP) tools.

The power-law behavior was attributed to a combination of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as well as behavioral changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Control interventions such as lockdown measures and mobility restrictions are incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each step in the random walk process. The step size l is taken to be a multiple of ⟨r⟩, which is the average separation between individuals. Three temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For l = ⟨r⟩, we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for smaller step sizes l ≲ ⟨r⟩/2, while for large l the growth is found to be exponential. We further performed a comparative case study of early fatality data (under varying levels of lockdown conditions) from three other countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement with these data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections in our simulations.},

A special challenge in systems biology is that ODE systems typically contain kinetic rate parameters, which are unknown and have to be estimated from data. However, non-linearity of ODE systems together with noise in the data raise severe identifiability issues. Hence, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches have been frequently used to estimate posterior distributions of rate parameters. However, designing a good MCMC sampler for high dimensional and multi-modal parameter distributions remains a challenging task. Here we performed a systematic comparison of different MCMC techniques for this purpose using five public domain models. The comparison included Metropolis-Hastings, parallel tempering MCMC, adaptive MCMC, and parallel adaptive MCMC. In conclusion, we found specifically parallel adaptive MCMC to produce superior parameter estimates while benefitting from inclusion of our suggested informative Bayesian priors for rate parameters and noise variance.},

Most of the existing research related to the mobility of people and COVID-19 spread is focused on investigating highly frequented paths by analyzing data collected from mobile devices, which mainly refer to geo-positioning records. In contrast, this paper tackles the problem by studying mass mobility. The relations between daily mobility on public transport (subway or metro) in three big cities and mortality due to COVID-19 are investigated. Data collected for these purposes come from official sources, such as the web pages of the cities’ local governments. To provide a systematic framework, we applied the IBM Foundational Methodology for Data Science to the epidemiological domain of this paper. Our analysis consists of moving averages with a moving window equal to seven days so as to avoid bias due to weekly tendencies. Among the main findings of this work are: a) New York City and Madrid show similar distribution on studied variables, which resemble a Gauss bell, in contrast to Mexico City, and b) Non-pharmaceutical interventions don’t bring immediate results, and reductions to the number of deaths due to COVID are observed after a certain number of days. This paper yields partial evidence for assessing the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {The expectation-maximization algorithm is a commonly employed tool for system identification. However, for a large set of state-space models, the maximization step cannot be solved analytically. In these situations, a natural remedy is to make use of the expectation-maximization gradient algorithm, i.e., to replace the maximization step by a single iteration of Newton’s method. We propose alternative expectationmaximization algorithms that replace the maximization step with a single iteration of some other well-known optimization method. These algorithms parallel the expectation-maximization gradient algorithm while relaxing the assumption of a concave objective function. The benefit of the proposed expectation-maximization algorithms is demonstrated with examples based on standard observation models in tracking and localization.},

  abstract = {Epidemics are inherently stochastic, and stochastic models provide an appropriate way to describe and analyse such phenomena. Given temporal incidence data consisting of, for example, the number of new infections or removals in a given time window, a continuous-time discretevalued Markov process provides a natural description of the dynamics of each model component, typically taken to be the number of susceptible, exposed, infected or removed individuals. Fitting the SEIR model to time-course data is a challenging problem due incomplete observations and, consequently, the intractability of the observed data likelihood. Whilst sampling based inference schemes such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are routinely applied, their computational cost typically restricts analysis to data sets of no more than a few thousand infective cases. Instead, we develop a sequential inference scheme that makes use of a computationally cheap approximation of the most natural Markov process model. Crucially, the resulting model allows a tractable conditional parameter posterior which can be summarised in terms of a set of low dimensional statistics. This is used to rejuvenate parameter samples in conjunction with a novel bridge construct for propagating state trajectories conditional on the next observation of cumulative incidence. The resulting inference framework also allows for stochastic infection and reporting rates. We illustrate our approach using synthetic and real data applications.},

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading and causing a severe health crisis in Indonesia. In the absence of medically proven vaccines, official authorities commonly adopt a social control approach under the strict public order. The Indonesian Government is no different, which imposed a large scale social restriction as an intervention strategy in Jakarta and other major cities. In this paper, we aim to quantify the correlation between human mobility and the daily new cases of COVID-19 which are further divided into two main distinct patterns: weekdays and weekends. We utilized the big data sources presented by reputable online service providers include Apple, Waze, and Google in terms of the reported daily mobility patterns. The mobility patterns include driving and walking activities as well as the movement trends across different public places such as retail and recreation, pharmacies, groceries, parks, etc from March 1 to July 31, 2020. To capture the real growth rate of COVID19, we use the official data reported by Governmental Disease Response Acceleration Task Force. Our cross-correlation analysis revealed that in Jakarta (province-level) and Indonesia (country-level), the COVID-19 case daily growth rate is correlated with the human mobility patterns of driving and walking activities on both weekends and weekdays time. Our work put the additional insight in supporting the importance of social distancing as an effective mitigation strategy to combat the coronavirus outbreak.},

  abstract = {Background: Monitoring the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires accurate estimation of the effective reproduction number (Rt ). However, existing methods for calculating Rt may yield biased estimates if important real-world factors, such as delays in confirmation, pre-symptomatic transmissions, or imperfect data observation, are not considered. Method: To include real-world factors, we expanded the susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered (SEIR) model by incorporating pre-symptomatic (P) and asymptomatic (A) states, creating the SEPIAR model. By utilizing both stochastic and deterministic versions of the model, and incorporating predetermined time series of Rt , we generated simulated datasets that simulate real-world challenges in estimating Rt . We then compared the performance of our proposed particle filtering method for estimating Rt with the existing EpiEstim approach based on renewal equations. Results: The particle filtering method accurately estimated Rt even in the presence of data with delays, pre-symptomatic transmission, and imperfect observation. When evaluating via the root mean square error (RMSE) metric, the performance of the particle filtering method was better in general and was comparable to the EpiEstim approach if perfectly deconvolved infection time series were provided, and substantially better when Rt exhibited short-term fluctuations and the data was right truncated. Conclusions: The SEPIAR model, in conjunction with the particle filtering method, offers a reliable tool for predicting the transmission trend of COVID-19 and assessing the impact of intervention strategies. This approach enables enhanced monitoring of COVID-19 transmission and can inform public health policies aimed at controlling the spread of the disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now spread throughout most countries in the world causing heavy life losses and damaging social-economic impacts. Following a stochastic point process modelling approach, a Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to represent the COVID-19 spread dynamics. First, we examined various expected performances (theoretical properties) of the simulation model assuming a number of arbitrarily defined scenarios. Simulation studies were then performed on the real COVID-19 data reported (over the period of 1 March to 1 May) for Australia and United Kingdom (UK). Given the initial number of COVID-19 infection active cases were around 10 for both countries, the model estimated that the number of active cases would peak around 29 March in Australia (≈~1,700 cases) and around 22 April in UK (≈~22,860 cases); ultimately the total confirmed cases could sum to 6,790 for Australia in about 75~days and 206,480 for UK in about 105~days. The results of the estimated COVID-19 reproduction numbers were consistent with what was reported in the literature. This simulation model was considered an effective and adaptable decision making/what-if analysis tool in battling COVID-19 in the immediate need, and for modelling any other infectious diseases in the future.},

  abstract = {Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25\$\textbackslash times\$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.
